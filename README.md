Eggys Big Adventure was my first game made in Unity. It was a 2D platformer that uses a lot of Unitys prebuilt physics to create a fun little bouncy game. I added some enemies and overall it came out with a nice clean feel.

Made for Unity version 2017.1.1f1 (Opening in different versions can cause unexpected errors)
